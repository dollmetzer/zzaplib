zzaplib
=======

Zzaplib is a lightweight PHP application framework.
The first version was used in a now defunct messaging application named zzap in 2006-2009.
It was under constant development since then for various web applications.

The requirements are:

- MVC structure
- lean code, high speed and low memory usage
- support multiple sites, multiple languages and multiple devices
- Easy maintainable

Installation using composer
---------------------------
Insert the following into your project composer.json:

    "require": {
        "dollmetzer/zzaplib": "dev-master"
    },
    "repositories": [

            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git://github.com/dollmetzer/zzaplib",
